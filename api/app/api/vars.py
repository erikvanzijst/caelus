    ## Parameters
    - **user_id** — owner of the deployment.
    - **deployment_id** — UUID of the deployment.
    - **phase** — when the value is consumed. `runtime` is the only phase.

    ## Behavior
    Reports the deployment's *desired* vars, which is not necessarily what the
    running pod holds — `pending` is true when a rollout would change the
    pod's environment.

    A var marked sensitive is returned **without its `value` field**: not a
    mask, not a null, and no digest. The response is therefore safe to modify
    and submit back: an entry with no `value` leaves that var untouched.

    ## Errors
    - **403 Forbidden** — reading another account's vars without administrator

    ## Authorization
    You may only write your own deployments' vars; administrators may write

    ## Parameters
    - **user_id** — owner of the deployment.
    - **deployment_id** — UUID of the deployment.
    - **phase** — when the value is consumed. `runtime` is the only phase.

    ## Behavior
    Keys present in the body are written; keys absent from it are untouched.
    Within an entry, `value` has three distinct meanings:

    - a string — set the var to it;
    - `null` — delete the var;
    - **absent** — leave the var's value unchanged, which is what makes a
      read's output safely writable. Naming a key that does not exist this way
      is an error, since there is nothing to leave unchanged.

    Writing does **not** roll the deployment out. The vars are recorded as
    desired state and `pending` reports that a rollout would change the pod.

    Nothing is written unless a value or its sensitivity actually changes, so
    re-submitting a deployment's own configuration records no history.

    ## Errors
    - **400 Bad Request** — a key that is not a legal environment variable
      name or is reserved by the platform, a value the template's schema
      rejects, a value over 8 KiB, vars totalling over 128 KiB or numbering
      over 256, sensitivity contradicting the schema, or making a sensitive
      var readable without supplying a new value. The error names the key and
      the constraint and never quotes the value.
    - **403 Forbidden** — writing another account's vars without administrator
      privileges.
    - **404 Not Found** — no such deployment for this user, or a phase other
      than `runtime`.
    - **409 Conflict** — the deployment is being deleted.
