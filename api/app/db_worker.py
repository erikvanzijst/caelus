"""The database housekeeping worker: periodic sweeps over the tenant cluster.

One process, several ticks, each on its own cadence. The quota tick lives here;
the purge and orphan ticks join it later.

**Ticks share a process but not a `try`.** Purge performs the only irreversible
operation in this subsystem and a bug there must not stop quota enforcement, or
the reverse, so a tick that raises is logged and its neighbors still run.

No keyring verification at startup, unlike the API and `caelus worker`: every
tick connects as the platform admin and none of them decrypts a tenant password
(design D10).
