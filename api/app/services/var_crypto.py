"""Encryption of stored secrets under a rotatable Fernet keyring.

Every column encrypted under it is declared
in ``ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS`` below, and the two operator-facing sweeps -- the
startup check and the rotation -- iterate that registry. That is what makes
"what is encrypted under this keyring" answerable in
one place, which is the question an operator is really asking before retiring a
key: a column the checks do not know about passes startup and then strands its
plaintext the moment the key it names is dropped.

Each row records the *fingerprint* of the key that encrypted it -- the first
4 bytes of ``sha256`` over the decoded key material, as lowercase hex -- and
never a position in the configured list. Rotation introduces a key by
prepending, so a positional identifier would silently come to name a
different key on every historical row: an identifier destroyed by the one
operation it exists to support.

``MultiFernet`` is deliberately not used. Its try-every-key decryption exists
to work around a token that carries no key identifier; once a row carries one,
a direct lookup is O(1) and fails with something actionable -- naming the
fingerprint that is missing -- rather than an undifferentiated ``InvalidToken``
that cannot tell a retired key from a corrupted row.
