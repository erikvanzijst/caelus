"""Deployment vars: the effective set, writes, release snapshots, `pending`.

`deployment_var` is an append-only history (see `app/models/core.py`), so
nothing here updates a row: a write inserts, a delete inserts a tombstone, and
the deployment's *effective* configuration -- its **head** -- is derived.

Two invariants this module exists to keep:

  * head is resolved in exactly one function, because the tombstone filter is
    easy to omit and the omission is silent -- a deleted var would come back;

  * every write and every snapshot binding takes the deployment's row lock
    first, which gives a total order per deployment and stops a var write from
    landing between head resolution and the `release_var` insert.
