"""`custom` declares an application-container session root, and what that grants
is load-bearing.

It puts a shell in the tenant's own application container, and file transfer
into it, from one container beside it. Three properties make that acceptable
rather than alarming, and each is one field that would fail silently if it were
dropped:

* the shared process namespace is the **pod's**, never the node's -- process
  identifiers resolve within the namespace that shares them, so this is what
  bounds the sidecar to the tenant's own containers;
* the application container gains **nothing** from the declaration, and no
  container takes an added capability;
* the image reference is a **system value pinned to an exact version**, because
  that container holds the platform's trusted key.

None of the three has a runtime symptom when wrong -- a `hostPID` pod works, an
application container with extra capabilities works, a moving tag works until
two nodes disagree -- so they are asserted here.

What every product's chart must render, and the classification of the catalog
that keeps a product from acquiring SSH access by omission, live in
`test_ssh_chart_contract.py`. This file is only about what `custom` gets that a
curated product does not.
