"""The mutual deployment/release reference, against a real Postgres.

Everything here is invisible on SQLite. `api/app/db.py` never sets
`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`, so SQLite enforces no foreign keys at all: an
insert-order mistake, a dangling pointer, or a constraint that was never
created passes the rest of the suite green and fails in production. These
assertions only mean something where the constraints are real.

Set `POSTGRES_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to run them, e.g.
`postgresql+psycopg://caelus:caelus@postgres:5432/caelus_pgtest`.

Self-contained on purpose: rows are built with plain SQL against a schema this
module creates itself, so nothing here depends on the service layer's current
required fields or on state another test left behind.
