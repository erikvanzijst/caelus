"""`freepod cp`: which side is the deployment's, and the refusals made first.

The transfer itself is `sftp`'s, so it is stubbed to capture the argv and the
batch script it is fed; everything up to that call, including every refusal
that needs no connection, is real. The copy running end to end against a live
deployment is what `openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-03-unified-ssh-sidecar/tasks.md` § 6.2 covers.
