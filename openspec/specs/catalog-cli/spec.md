# catalog-cli Specification

## Purpose

Defines the `caelus catalog apply|curate|lint` command surface, what each
verb guarantees, and why this group is intentionally exempt from the
repository's REST parity convention.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The CLI provides a catalog command group
The CLI SHALL provide a `catalog` command group exposing `apply`, `curate`, and
`lint`. There is no command to release a product from the catalog: that is
expressed by removing its catalog file, which the reconciler applies on the next
rollout. These commands are operator and build tooling rather
than tenant-facing API surface, so they SHALL be CLI-only and are exempt from
the REST parity convention. The write guard they rely on lives in the service
layer, so the protections they enforce remain identical across the REST API,
the CLI, and the admin UI.

#### Scenario: Catalog commands are available
- **WHEN** an admin runs the CLI help
- **THEN** the `catalog` command group SHALL be listed with its subcommands

#### Scenario: No REST equivalent is required
- **WHEN** the catalog commands are added
- **THEN** no corresponding REST endpoints SHALL be required for parity

### Requirement: Apply reconciles a catalog directory into the database
`catalog apply` SHALL read every catalog file in a given directory, validate
them, and apply them through the reconciler within a single transaction. It
SHALL support a dry-run mode that reports the actions it would take — products
created, products adopted, templates inserted, and canonical pointers moved —
without writing to the database. A validation or reconciliation failure SHALL
cause a non-zero exit status and leave the database unchanged.

#### Scenario: Apply reconciles the directory
- **WHEN** an admin runs `catalog apply` against a valid catalog directory
- **THEN** the catalog SHALL be reconciled and the command SHALL exit zero

#### Scenario: Dry run writes nothing
- **WHEN** an admin runs `catalog apply` in dry-run mode
- **THEN** the planned actions SHALL be reported
- **AND** the database SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Failure is atomic
- **WHEN** one catalog file in the directory is invalid
- **THEN** the command SHALL exit non-zero
- **AND** no changes from any file in that run SHALL be persisted

### Requirement: Curate generates catalog files from database state
`catalog curate` SHALL write a product's catalog document and its icon into the
catalog directory, derived from the current database state, so that a hand-tuned
product can be graduated into the catalog without hand-authoring YAML. Curate
SHALL round-trip exactly: applying a generated file to the database it came from
MUST match the existing template by spec equality and insert no new template
rows.

Writing the files SHALL NOT curate the product. Curation takes effect only when
the reconciler applies the committed catalog during a rollout, so the command
SHALL report the steps that remain, naming the files it wrote.

#### Scenario: Curate writes the catalog document and icon
- **WHEN** an admin runs `catalog curate` for a product
- **THEN** the product's catalog document SHALL be written into the catalog
  directory
- **AND** its icon SHALL be written to the icon path the document references

#### Scenario: Curate reports the remaining steps
- **WHEN** `catalog curate` completes
- **THEN** it SHALL report the files it wrote
- **AND** SHALL state that the change must be committed and merged before the
  product becomes curated

#### Scenario: Curate does not change product state
- **WHEN** `catalog curate` completes for a non-curated product
- **THEN** that product's `curated` flag and `slug` SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Curate round-trips without churn
- **WHEN** a product is curated and the resulting file is applied to the same
  database
- **THEN** no new template row SHALL be inserted
- **AND** the product's canonical `template_id` SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Curate targets a single product
- **WHEN** an admin runs `catalog curate` for a named product
- **THEN** only that product's catalog document SHALL be written

#### Scenario: Generated upstream block requires completion
- **WHEN** a product's catalog document is generated
- **THEN** the emitted `upstream` block SHALL be present for the operator to
  complete, since release-detection metadata is not derivable from the database

### Requirement: Lint validates catalog files without a database
`catalog lint` SHALL validate a catalog directory using only the files
themselves, so it can run in continuous integration where no database or
cluster is reachable. It SHALL verify that each file parses, declares a
supported `schema_version`, has a slug matching its filename, declares unique
slugs across the directory, does not declare `visibility`, contains a
`values_schema` that is a valid JSON Schema document, and declares an
`upstream.match` expression that compiles and defines a `version` capture
group. It SHALL also verify that any referenced icon file exists inside the
catalog directory and can be processed as an image, so that a missing or
corrupt icon is caught in review rather than failing a rollout. It SHALL also
verify that the generated `catalog.schema.json` has not drifted from the
Pydantic models it is generated from; `catalog lint --write-schema`
regenerates it.

#### Scenario: Lint passes on a valid catalog
- **WHEN** continuous integration runs `catalog lint` on a valid catalog
  directory
- **THEN** the command SHALL exit zero

#### Scenario: Lint rejects a missing icon file
- **WHEN** a catalog file references an icon path that does not exist in the
  catalog directory
- **THEN** `catalog lint` SHALL exit non-zero and identify the offending file

#### Scenario: Lint rejects an invalid values schema
- **WHEN** a catalog file's `values_schema` is not a valid JSON Schema document
- **THEN** `catalog lint` SHALL exit non-zero and identify the offending file

#### Scenario: Lint requires no database
- **WHEN** `catalog lint` runs with no database configured
- **THEN** it SHALL complete validation without attempting a database
  connection
