# Caelus UI

React + TypeScript + MUI frontend for the Caelus API.

This README is intentionally behavior-heavy so future agents can quickly orient themselves in the UI without re-discovering interaction details.

## Stack
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite
- MUI v7 (with custom theme)
- TanStack React Query
- MUI X DataGrid (community)
- React Router (`/`, `/admin/products`, `/admin/deployments`)

## Local Run
Requirements:
- Node 18+
- API running at `http://localhost:8000`

Install and run:
```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Optional API URL override:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```

Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## App Structure
- `src/App.tsx`: route switch (`/` Dashboard, `/settings` and `/admin`, each with nested panel routes).
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx`: global layout shell, top app bar, nav buttons, signed-in chip, email switch button, decorative radial background, and email dialog gating.
- `src/components/EmailDialog.tsx`: modal to capture local dev email.
- `src/components/SectionSidebar.tsx`: collapsible section nav for a page composed of panels. Shared by Admin and Settings so the two cannot drift.
- `src/components/AdminSidebar.tsx`: the Admin page's nav items, over `SectionSidebar`.
- `src/components/SshKeysPanel.tsx`: the account's SSH public keys — list, add, revoke.
- `src/components/AddSshKeyDialog.tsx`: paste or drop a public key; maps the platform's error `code` to a readable message.
- `src/components/CopyButton.tsx`: copy-to-clipboard with a confirmation tick. Shared by the SFTP fields and the SSH key list.
- `src/components/DatabasePanel.tsx`: the deployment's database panel — identity, credential (masked, copyable without reveal) and quota state, with the same "renders nothing on a 404" shape as `SftpAccessPanel`.
- `src/components/DatabaseFields.tsx`: the presentational fields rendered by `DatabasePanel` (database name, role, masked password, usage against allowance, state).
- `src/components/DatabaseAccessDialog.tsx`: focused modal opened from the deployment card mirroring `SftpAccessDialog`.
- `src/components/ProductsPanel.tsx`: product/template management (extracted from Admin page).
- `src/components/DeploymentsPanel.tsx`: admin deployments table using MUI DataGrid with sortable columns.
- `src/components/DeploymentDialog.tsx`: deployment detail dialog with read-only form, metadata, upgrade, and delete actions with live polling.
- `src/components/NewProduct.tsx`: extracted component for product creation form with icon upload support.
- `src/components/IconInput.tsx`: icon upload component with preview and automatic client-side downscaling for oversized images.
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: user deployment creation + deployment cards.
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx`: admin layout shell with sidebar and `<Outlet>` for nested routes.
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx`: account settings shell, same shape as Admin. Available to every signed-in user.
- `src/api/client.ts`: request helpers with `ApiError` class carrying the HTTP status and the platform's machine-readable error `code`.
- `src/api/endpoints.ts`: endpoint wrappers.
- `src/state/useAuthEmail.ts`: localStorage-backed auth email hook.
- `src/utils/formatDate.ts`: local-time ISO timestamp formatting.
- `src/utils/deploymentStatus.ts`: deployment status color and transitional state helpers.
- `src/theme.ts`: color/typography/shape/component overrides.

## Global Layout And Visuals
- Top-level shell uses full-height page with a sticky translucent app bar.
- App bar sections:
  - Left: avatar `C`, title `Caelus Control`, subtitle `Provisioning cockpit`
  - Center: `Dashboard` and `Admin` nav buttons
  - Right: signed-in email chip + `Switch` button
- Main content is wrapped in `Container maxWidth="xl"` with generous vertical spacing.
- Global background is a soft radial gradient; shell also adds two blurred radial accent circles.
- Typography uses Space Grotesk / Space Mono, rounded controls, pill-shaped buttons.

## Auth Email Behavior
- All API requests may include `x-auth-request-email`.
- Email source is localStorage key: `caelus.auth.email`.
- First load with no stored email shows a blocking dialog (`Confirm your email`) and prevents dismissing with empty input.
- `Switch` re-opens the dialog to change email.

Important current behavior:
- `useAuthEmail()` is local state per hook call (not shared context).
- Updating email from `AppShell` does not immediately update `Dashboard`/`Admin` hook instances in the same render tree.
- In practice, after entering email in a fresh session, data queries on pages may remain disabled until full page reload/navigation remount.
- After reload, both routes initialize from localStorage and behave normally.

## Dashboard (`/`)

The user's own deployments. `DeployDialog` creates one — its fields are driven
by the product's template schema through `UserValuesForm`, the hostname through
`HostnameField`, and a user's first launch is gated on ToS consent — and each
deployment card's `Edit` re-opens the same dialog in edit mode. Cards show the
reconcile status and surface `last_error` inline.

Spec: [edit-deployment-frontend](../openspec/specs/edit-deployment-frontend/spec.md),
[deploy-dialog-shared](../openspec/specs/deploy-dialog-shared/spec.md),
[hostname-field-ui](../openspec/specs/hostname-field-ui/spec.md),
[deploy-tos-consent-ui](../openspec/specs/deploy-tos-consent-ui/spec.md)

## Admin (`/admin`)

The administrative surface: a section nav over four panels — **Products**,
**Deployments**, **Users**, and **Plans**. Products are managed in a detail
panel whose template versions are tabbed, each tab a read-only viewer with a
live schema preview and a make-canonical action. Deployments is a sortable
table of every non-deleted deployment backed by a dedicated admin endpoint; a
row opens a detail dialog with upgrade and delete, polling a single deployment
while it is in a transitional state. Users lists accounts with their deployment
counts.

Spec: [admin-product-detail](../openspec/specs/admin-product-detail/spec.md),
[admin-template-tabs](../openspec/specs/admin-template-tabs/spec.md),
[admin-schema-preview](../openspec/specs/admin-schema-preview/spec.md),
[admin-list-deployments-endpoint](../openspec/specs/admin-list-deployments-endpoint/spec.md),
[admin-users-panel](../openspec/specs/admin-users-panel/spec.md)

## API And Query Notes
- API base URL: `VITE_API_URL` or default `http://localhost:8000`.
- `requestJson` always sends `Content-Type: application/json`.
- `204` responses map to `null`.
- Error handling normalizes FastAPI `detail` values (including validation arrays) into readable messages. Errors throw `ApiError` (extends `Error`) with an `status` property carrying the HTTP status code.
- Query defaults:
  - `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`
  - `retry: 1`
  - `staleTime: 5000ms`
- Dashboard deployments query auto-polls every 3s while any deployment is in transitional states (`provisioning` or `deleting`).
- Admin deployment dialog polls a single deployment at 1s intervals during transitions, patching the list cache via `setQueryData`.

## Settings (`/settings`)

The account-level surface — everything here belongs to the person, not one
deployment — reachable from the account menu and available to every signed-in
user; it is not an administrative feature and must not read as one. It uses the
same section-nav-plus-`<Outlet>` shape as `/admin`, so a second account section
is one nav entry and one route; today it holds a single section, the SSH keys
panel, which lists registered keys and adds or revokes them.

Two implementation choices the spec leaves open: adding a key also accepts a
**dropped `.pub` file** (the whole dialog body is the drop target, with a
`browse` link so it is reachable by keyboard); and the add dialog resets on
exit rather than in a close handler, because the panel closes it directly after
a successful add without passing through any cancel path and the component
stays mounted throughout.

Spec: [account-settings-ui](../openspec/specs/account-settings-ui/spec.md)

## Database panel

A deployment whose product opts into relational storage gets a panel on the
deployment view, mounted beside the SFTP panel in the same shape. It shows the
database's identity, a masked credential, and its health against its allowance,
and states how the database is reached. It is its own component
(`DatabasePanel`), composed into the page.

Spec: [database-credentials-ui](../openspec/specs/database-credentials-ui/spec.md),
[sftp-credentials-ui](../openspec/specs/sftp-credentials-ui/spec.md)

## Manual QA Matrix
Use these checks after UI/API contract changes. The acceptance criteria they
assert are normative in the capability specs the sections above link; the rows
that restate a spec scenario, and that scenario's governing spec, are: settings
reachability (row 0) → [account-settings-ui](../openspec/specs/account-settings-ui/spec.md);
template and canonical behavior (rows 1–3) →
[admin-template-tabs](../openspec/specs/admin-template-tabs/spec.md);
deployment create (row 4) →
[deploy-dialog-shared](../openspec/specs/deploy-dialog-shared/spec.md);
the admin deployments table (row 7) →
[admin-list-deployments-endpoint](../openspec/specs/admin-list-deployments-endpoint/spec.md);
and the database panel (row 11) →
[database-credentials-ui](../openspec/specs/database-credentials-ui/spec.md).

0. Settings reachability (non-admin):
   - sign in as a user without administrator privileges
   - expected: the account menu shows `Settings` and no `Admin`
   - expected: navigating directly to `/settings` renders the SSH keys panel

1. Template create (Admin):
   - open `/admin`, select a product
   - create template with `chart_ref=ghcr.io/example/foo`, `chart_version=1.2.3`
   - expected: request `POST /products/{id}/templates` returns `201`
   - expected: new row appears with `ghcr.io/example/foo:1.2.3`

2. Canonical template behavior:
   - set template canonical
   - expected: product chip updates to `Canonical template #{id}`

3. Template delete:
   - delete non-canonical template
   - expected: row removed and list refreshes
   - delete canonical template
   - expected: newest remaining template is auto-selected as canonical (if any)

4. Deployment create (Dashboard):
   - open `/`, pick product, configure user values (if required), click `Launch`
   - expected: request payload includes `desired_template_id` (not `template_id`)
   - expected: request payload does not include top-level `domainname`
   - expected: `POST /users/{id}/deployments` returns `201`
   - expected: new deployment card appears with correct product and desired template id

5. Deployment status visibility:
   - expected card fields: status chip, last reconcile timestamp
   - if backend sets `last_error`, expected inline error alert with readable message

6. Deployment delete UX:
   - click delete and confirm
   - expected button becomes `Deleting...` and disabled
   - expected polling refreshes card state while deleting

7. Admin deployments table:
   - open `/admin/deployments`
   - expected: sortable table with all non-deleted deployments
   - click a row: expected deployment dialog opens with read-only form and metadata
   - hostname links should open in new tab without triggering the dialog

8. Admin deployment upgrade:
   - open dialog for an outdated deployment (yellow warning icon)
   - expected: button shows `Upgrade to #N`
   - click upgrade: expected progress bar, status changes to `provisioning`, button disabled
   - expected: table row status updates in real time
   - on completion: button changes to `Up to date` (disabled)

9. Admin deployment delete:
   - open dialog, click Delete
   - expected: progress bar (secondary color), button shows `Deleting...`
   - expected: table row status updates to `deleting`
   - on completion: dialog closes, row removed from table

10. Validation error readability:
   - trigger invalid create payload (for example empty required template fields)
   - expected alert text is readable and not `[object Object]`

11. Database panel:
   - open a deployment whose product offers relational storage
   - expected: panel renders database name, role and a masked password
   - expected: password can be copied without first being revealed
   - expected: panel states that the database is reachable from the running app, not the reader's machine
   - open a deployment whose product does not offer relational storage
   - expected: no panel is rendered and no placeholder is shown
   - as an administrator, open another account's deployment
   - expected: every field is shown except the password, which the panel states is withheld — no error state, no reveal affordance that cannot work

## Product Icon Sizes

Product icons use a deliberate size hierarchy across contexts to reflect visual
importance and available space:

| Context                          | Size | Variant   | Notes                                           |
|----------------------------------|------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Product list (Admin)             | 48px | `rounded` | Compact list — scannable                        |
| Selected product detail (Admin)  | 64px | `rounded` | Detail view with edit badge overlay             |
| Deployment card (Dashboard)      | 64px | `rounded` | Primary dashboard content — instant recognition |

When adding icons to new contexts, pick a size that fits this hierarchy. List
items should stay at 48px or below; detail/card views should use 64px.

## Responsive Behavior
- Dashboard create form uses column layout on small screens, row layout on medium+.
- Admin left/right columns collapse into a single vertical flow on small screens.
- App bar content remains a single row; at very narrow widths it compresses tightly.

## Playwright Browser Testing (Local Dev)

In production (Kubernetes), authentication is handled by Keycloak via Traefik's
forward-auth middleware — no manual email setup is needed. In local dev mode,
however, the UI relies on a localStorage key for auth headers. When automating
the browser with Playwright MCP, always use `user@example.com` as the dev
email and follow this sequence to establish an authenticated session:

```
1. browser_navigate  →  http://localhost:5173
2. browser_evaluate  →  () => {
     localStorage.setItem('caelus.auth.headers',
       JSON.stringify({"X-Auth-Request-Email": "user@example.com"}));
     window.location.reload();
   }
3. browser_wait_for  →  text: "user@example.com"
4. browser_navigate  →  http://localhost:5173/admin  (or any target page)
5. browser_wait_for  →  text: "user@example.com"
```

**Why the wait is required:** Playwright's `goto()` resolves on the browser
`load` event, but React's auth cycle is async (mount → read localStorage →
`GET /api/me` → re-render). Without the wait, snapshots will show the
pre-auth state ("No email set", empty product lists, missing Admin link).
The `wait_for` on the email address ensures the full auth round-trip has
completed and the UI has re-rendered with user data.

**Why step 2 uses `reload()` instead of a second `navigate`:** Setting
localStorage after the React tree has mounted does not update the
`useState(getStoredAuthHeaders)` initializer. The reload forces a fresh
mount that picks up the new value synchronously.

## Known UI Caveats
- Auth email state is not globally shared; see the reload caveat in `Auth Email Behavior`.
