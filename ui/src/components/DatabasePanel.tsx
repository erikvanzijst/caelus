 *
 * That 404 also covers the interval before a deployment's first reconcile has
 * provisioned one, which is exactly an interval in which the deployment is not
 * settled. Callers re-request when it settles rather than showing a
 * database-specific "being prepared" state, which would duplicate the
 * deployment's own status in a second place that could disagree with it.
